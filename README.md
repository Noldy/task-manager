# task-manager
Manages your tasks

This app was made for the purpose of practising on Room, RecyclerView, ViewHolders, Adapters and general techniques used to make apps in Android Studio.

The user can add new tasks, along with some additional information if needed, delete them, view their info or check as completed. There is an additional activity which shows the list of completed tasks along with their total number.

The database was made using Room Persistence Library.
